# Custom ADK Session Services - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented four custom session services for Google ADK that provide persistent storage for session data using different backends:

1. **SQLSessionService** - Stores sessions in SQL databases using SQLAlchemy
2. **MongoSessionService** - Stores sessions in MongoDB
3. **RedisSessionService** - Stores sessions in Redis
4. **YamlFileSessionService** - Stores sessions in human-readable YAML files

## Implementation Details

### Base Architecture

All session services inherit from a common `BaseCustomSessionService` class that:
- Extends Google ADK's `BaseSessionService`
- Provides initialization and cleanup methods
- Implements proper error handling
- Ensures services are initialized before use

### SQLSessionService

**Technology**: SQLAlchemy ORM
**Features**:
- Supports all major SQL databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Automatic table creation
- JSON serialization for complex data types
- Proper transaction handling with rollback on errors

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Uses SQLAlchemy models for session storage
- Serializes session state and events to JSON for storage
- Implements proper connection management
- Handles database-specific considerations

### MongoSessionService

**Technology**: PyMongo
**Features**:
- Native document storage in MongoDB
- Automatic index creation for performance
- Direct storage of Python dictionaries
- Efficient querying capabilities

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Stores sessions as MongoDB documents
- Uses proper indexing on app_name and user_id for performance
- Handles connection pooling
- Implements efficient serialization/deserialization

### RedisSessionService

**Technology**: Redis with redis-py
**Features**:
- Extremely fast in-memory storage
- Key-based organization with namespaces
- Set-based tracking of user sessions
- Efficient data retrieval

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Uses Redis hashes for session storage
- Implements key namespacing to avoid conflicts
- Uses Redis sets to track user sessions
- Efficient serialization with JSON

### YamlFileSessionService

**Technology**: PyYAML with file system storage
**Features**:
- Human-readable YAML format
- Hierarchical directory structure
- No external database dependencies
- Easy backup and inspection

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Organizes files in app/user/session hierarchy
- Uses YAML for human-readable storage
- Implements proper file locking (implicitly through atomic operations)
- Handles file system permissions

## Testing

All services have been thoroughly tested with:
- Creation, retrieval, listing, and deletion of sessions
- Event appending and state management
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration with Google ADK session objects

## Usage

The services can be used directly or integrated with Google ADK runners:

```python
# Direct usage
service = YamlFileSessionService("./sessions")
await service.initialize()
session = await service.create_session(app_name="my_app", user_id="user123")

# With Google ADK
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=my_agent, session_service=service)
```

## Dependencies

Each service only requires its specific dependencies:
- SQLSessionService: `sqlalchemy`
- MongoSessionService: `pymongo`
- RedisSessionService: `redis`
- YamlFileSessionService: `PyYAML`

This modular approach allows users to only install what they need.

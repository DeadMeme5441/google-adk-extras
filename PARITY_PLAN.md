# Enhanced ADK Capabilities Expansion Plan

This document outlines the **strategic capabilities expansion** that google-adk-extras will implement to become the definitive enhanced ADK foundation. These features maintain complete independence while providing clean APIs that any system (including template-agent-builder) can leverage.

## Project Context

**Current State**: google-adk-extras v0.1.5 provides enhanced ADK runner capabilities with excellent tool execution strategies, circuit breakers, and performance monitoring.

**Strategic Vision**: Build independently excellent capabilities that establish google-adk-extras as the premier enhanced ADK foundation - supporting direct usage, FastAPI services, and integration by external systems like template-agent-builder.

**Philosophy**: We build superior capabilities with clean APIs. External systems adapt to leverage our excellence, not vice versa.
